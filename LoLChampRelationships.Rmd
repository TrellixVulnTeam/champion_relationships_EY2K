```{r setup, include=FALSE}
setwd("C:\\Users\\TORRES_SANT\\Documents\\Programming\\webscrapping\\champion_relationships")
champ_relations = read.csv("champions.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(igraph)
```

## Exploring The Data

Lets take a look at the data we got in our newly created .csv file.


```{r}

head(champ_relations)

str(champ_relations)

summary(champ_relations)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
